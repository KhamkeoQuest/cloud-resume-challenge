# Cloud Resume Challenge (Azure HA + AWS DR) 

Welcome to my **Cloud Resume Challenge** project, inspired by [Forrest Brazeal's](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) initiative. This is a **work in progress** that demonstrates deploying a static resume website using **Azure** as the primary infrastructure, with **AWS** configured for disaster recovery (DR).

---

## Project Goals

- Treat this like a **real-world, production** cloud system â€” not just a portfolio
- Build a **multi-environment (dev, stage, prod)** and **multi-cloud** deployment
- Stay within a **$10/month** budget while maximizing value and realism
- Integrate **CI/CD**, modular Terraform, monitoring, and secure practices

---

## What I'm Hoping to Learn

- Real-world **cloud architecture design and constraints**
- Modular and DRY **Terraform** across multiple environments
- Building for **cost-efficiency and maintainability**
- Azure: Storage, Static Sites, RBAC, Pipelines, DNS
- AWS: Static backup storage and fallback routing for DR
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions for automatic validation/deploys
- Observability and security hardening

## Current Progress (by Phase)

| Phase                            | Status        | Notes                                                                |
|----------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Frontend static site          | âœ… Basic Setup | HTML complete, placeholder content in place; styling WIP             |
| 2. Azure Infra (Dev/Stage/Prod)  | âœ… Complete    | Deployed via modular Terraform; resources verified in Azure          |
| 3. DR Planning in AWS            | ðŸ”œ Not Started | Will mirror static site with route failover and S3 backup            |
| 4. GitHub Actions CI/CD          | ðŸŸ¨ In Progress | Infra CI for dev being developed; frontend deploy automation planned |
| 5. Cost Monitoring & Optimization| ðŸ”œ Not Started | Budget enforced (~$10/mo); alerts and tracking to be added soon      |

Let me know:
- If there is anything else I should be considering, that I haven't yet
- This has actually ben a really fun project so far.
